# 🌐 Friend’s Website (Built While Learning Frontend)

This project is a **responsive website** I built for a friend while practicing frontend development.  
It’s not my personal portfolio, but it gave me a chance to **learn and apply HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** in a real project.

---

## ✨ About the Project

-   📱 Fully responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile
-   🎨 Modern animations and clean UI
-   🖼️ Modular **gallery system** with auto-generated thumbnails and JSON metadata
-   📩 Contact section with form integration and pill-shaped social links
-   ⚡ Lightweight, no heavy frameworks — just HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS

---

## 💡 My Learning Goals

I took on this project because I wanted to **get hands-on experience** in frontend development.  
Here’s what I practiced while building this site:

-   Structuring pages with **HTML5**
-   Styling with **CSS3**, Flexbox, and Grid
-   Writing **JavaScript** for dynamic features (gallery, menu, responsiveness)
-   Making a site **responsive and mobile-friendly**
-   Handling contact forms with **Formspree**
-   Debugging layout issues like overflow, responsiveness, and animations
